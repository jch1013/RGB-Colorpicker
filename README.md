<h1><a href="https://jch1013.github.io/RGB-Colorpicker/">RGB Color Picker</a></h1>
<h4>Purpose:</h4>
The goal of this project is to create a tool that makes it easier to pick rgb colors. I think that the main results on google for rbg color pickers are more difficult to use than they need to be, and this project aims to make a very simple web app to make choosing colors easier.

<h4>How it works:</h4>
To begin, select an inital color from the provided starter colors. Next, refine your color selection by clicking on the varying shades of color shown below. When you have a value you are satisfied with, right-click on the color to copy it to your clipboard.

<h4>Tech used:</h4>
